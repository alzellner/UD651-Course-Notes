UD651 Udacity's Exploratory Data Analysis Course Notes by Andrew Andrade || mrandrewandrade.com  || March 22nd, 2014 || (CC BY-NC 2.5)

Following along the couse, I created my own course notes using examples from the lesson and came up with a really really rough (done is better than perfect) version of the notes consisting mostly of examples.  I use the notes a quick refresher of the syntax for certain commands.  Please feel free to add addional comments and notes for the content of the lectures. 


 The code for the notes are in the .Rmd file and the .md and .html is autogenerated via Knit on R Studio.
